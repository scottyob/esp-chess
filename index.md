## ESP-Chess

ESP-Chess is a physical board, powered by the ESP32 controller.  The board connects to a web service and acts as an Amazon IoT "thing" to synchronize the state with a cloud service that allows the board to be used to play other parties over the internet.

This is very much a work in progress.

### Building

Eventually, we will upload our design files so you can build a copy of the board yourself.  This project is very new, we'll get to it soon enough.
